##### Project at work: Automatic Financial Reporting System

I developed the Automatic Financial Reporting System when I work as Business Intelligence Analyst at a Fintech company in Toronto. The Company focus on foreign exchange trading and providing global payroll services to clients who have the demands to pay employee globally with different currencies.

For Financial analysts in Business Analytics department have monthly financial reporting works, they will have to calculate and generate monthly reports/statements based on pre-determined business rules, formulas. The processes used to require many manual works on Excel while Excel also often crashes when data reach a considerable large amount.

My solution is a combination of R, Python, Alteryx, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server, with usually Alteryx used to pull and perform data cleanning on raw transaction data from SQL Server database and R, Python, Tableau Prep used for complex calculation and data transformation and Tableau Server and Python for batch pdf statement generation and distribution.

The idea is to achieve an all back-end hands-free automatic data ETL + reporting pipeline
